# NexusFlow

NexusFlow is a production-minded Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) project that ingests documents, indexes them, and serves grounded answers through a clean API. Built on AWS with event-driven processing, distributed embedding, experiment tracking, a vector database, and a containerized service, it’s designed to demonstrate practical MLOps: reliable automation, scalability, and cost awareness—plus a small demo UI and CI/CD—to show how an AI system moves from raw files to real-time answers in production.
